For heavy test or light test, charge to full battery, then open Powershell as admin and navigate to the "manualTests" directory. Then, dot-source fullTest.ps1 (. .\fullTest.ps1), and use the command "ManualMain -save C:\save\to\directory -mode heavyOrLight", with the arguments replaced with those of your choice. Heavy test requires that FurMark be installed in C:\Program Files (x86)\Geeks3D\Benchmarks\FurMark\FurMark.exe
For an average test (more complicated), run installAvgTester.ps1 NOT as admin. That will also add it to your startup programs and save the data to C:\batteryTest\avgBatteryData.txt. You can use getResults.py to see the score, in minutes per percent.
